## Designed for exploration, creativity, and encouraging fun interactions.
With a litany of world generation mods, as well as big gameplay changes like [Combatify](https://modrinth.com/mod/combatify), [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create), and [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins), It's not big enough to be overwhelming, but different enough to be a brand new experience!

The server version of the pack is currently private, as modrinth lacks good ways to distinguish version branches right now. It may be uploaded as a seperate project in future.

# ⚠︎ This is in Alpha! ⚠︎
Expect bugs, missing features, experimental changes, and potentially even crashes!
